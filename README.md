# DataScience_A/B-Test
## Description
A company recently introduced a new type of bidding, "average bidding", as an alternative to the existing type of bidding called "maximumbidding". One of our clients, bombabomba.com, decided to test this new feature and wants to run an A/B test to see if average bidding brings more conversions than maximumbidding. The A/B test has been running for 1 month and bombabomba.com is now waiting for you to analyze the results of this A/B test. 
The ultimate measure of success for Bombabomba.com is "Purchase". Therefore, for statistical tests, the focus should be on the "Purchase" metric.
## Content
